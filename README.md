# 🧩 Parallel Sudoku Generator

## 📖 Overview

Sudoku solving can be a time-consuming process, especially for larger and more difficult puzzles. To reduce the time required to solve complex puzzles, this project proposes applying parallelism to the Sudoku generator.

## 🎯 Scope

The Sudoku generator will be divided into smaller sub-puzzles and implemented using the Rust programming language. The parallel approach can be used for generators and solvers. Performance metrics such as ⏱️ time taken, 💻 CPU cores used, and 🚀 speedup achieved will be used to measure the efficiency of the parallel Sudoku generator. The quality of the generated puzzles will also be validated to ensure they have unique solutions and are solvable by the backtracking algorithm. A graphical user interface will allow users to customize the puzzle size and difficulty, generate random puzzles, or input their own puzzles. Automated tests and manual testing will validate the correctness of the algorithm and user interface's functionality.

## 🎉 Conclusion

This project aims to improve the performance of Sudoku generators and solvers by applying parallelism to the process. The potential practical applications of this project are significant, as it can reduce the time required to solve complex Sudoku puzzles, making it practical for many applications.
